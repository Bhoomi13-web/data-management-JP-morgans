 Project Title
"JP Morgan Classification for Legal Documents using CRISP-DM"
ðŸ”¹ Introduction
The project focuses on converting business problems into analytical problems using the CRISP-DM methodology.
Inspired by JP Morganâ€™s COIN (Contract Intelligence) system.
COIN uses machine learning to automate legal document review, identify patterns, and classify clauses accurately and efficiently.
Major benefits: time-saving, error reduction, and automation of legal reviews.
ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
JP Morgan's COIN automates the classification of a wide variety of legal documents.
It replaces manual efforts that would require thousands of lawyer hours.
It delivers results faster and with fewer errors by recognizing compliance-related patterns.
ðŸ”¹ CRISP-DM Methodology Applied
The six phases applied to solve the problem:
Business Understanding
Automate legal document analysis, improve consistency and accuracy.
(The rest of the phases likely follow: Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment â€“ but are not fully visible in the preview.)
